			<h2>Terms and conditions</h2>
				<p>
				</p><p>By placing an order on the Serenata Flowers website or when 
calling our customer services team, you are agreeing to the following 
terms and conditions:</p>
				<p>You must be <strong>over 18</strong> to place an order for 
alcoholic products on the Serenata Flowers website. By placing an order,
 you confirm that you or the recipient of an alcohol gift are over the 
age of 18.</p>				
				<br><h4>Order Acceptance Policy</h4>
				<p>All orders received are subject to acceptance by Serenata 
Commerce Limited and we reserve the right to reject any order without 
giving reasons. In the event of rejection, we will refund or cancel any 
payments received via the payment method used to place the order.</p>
				<p>All prices shown are inclusive of VAT at the prevailing rate (currently %).</p>
				<br><h4>Changes to your order</h4>
				<p>If you wish to change your order, please do so via the My Account
 area of the Serenata Flowers website. We'll always do our best to make 
last-minute changes for you, but we can only guarantee changes 
(including to the delivery address and card message) requested <!-- made by 6pm on the day before --> at least 24 hours before dispatch. <em>Please note that once orders have been 'assigned to production', no changes can be accepted.</em></p>
				<p><strong>For peak season (Valentine's Day and Mother's Day), we 
are unable to guarantee to accept changes to orders within 72 hours of 
the intended delivery date.</strong></p>
				<br><h4>Cancelling your order</h4>
				<p>Orders can normally be cancelled up to 48 hours before the 
intended delivery date. You can cancel your order via the My Account 
area of the Serenata Flowers website or by telephoning customer 
services. <em>Please note that once orders have been 'assigned to production', orders cannot be cancelled.</em>
				</p><p><strong>For peak season (Valentine's Day and Mother's Day), 
we are unable to guarantee to cancel orders within 72 hours of the 
intended delivery date.</strong></p>
				<br><h4>Payment problems</h4>
				<p>Our website has a secure checkout (we use Thawte SSL Certificates
 and pass the FBI/SANS Internet Security Test), so we encourage you to 
place your orders online. On occasion, however, bank-related payment 
failures occur that prevent us from accepting your order immediately.</p>
				<p>Occasionally, card details that are entered correctly and backed 
by sufficient funds are not validated because the card issuer is 
performing a random security check. In these cases, although we'll have 
received your order, we'll need to take payment over the phone. We'll 
email or call you as soon as possible in these circumstances. If you 
receive a message telling you that payment has not been validated, 
please contact our customer service team immediately to ensure your 
order is delivered on time.</p>
				<p>Owing to time differences, payments made out of office hours, or 
problems getting hold of you via the contact details you've provided, 
we're sometimes unable to process a valid payment prior to the requested
 delivery date. Although this delay is regrettable, it is outside our 
control and we cannot offer any form of refund in these circumstances.</p>
				<br><h4>Timed deliveries</h4>
				<p>We offer a number of timed delivery options. However, please note
 that other than these standard delivery options, we are unfortunately 
unable to make deliveries within customer-specified time periods.</p>
				<br><h4>Delivery policies</h4>
				<p>For full information related to our delivery-related policies, please see our <a href="Flower_delivery.aspx">delivery information</a> page.</p>

				<br><h4>Flower availability and substitution</h4>
				<p>All floral products are subject to availability. In the event of 
any supply difficulties or if the flowers we have received from our 
growers that are needed to make up your order do not meet our high 
quality standards, we reserve the right to substitute any product with 
an alternate product of a similar style and equivalent (or greater) 
value and quality. Where this is necessary, and the substitution is 
significant, we will try to contact you via email. If you wish to 
discuss the substitution we have made, please contact our customer 
services team. <em>Please note that foliage and sundries (including vases) may be substituted without notice</em>.</p>
				<p>If we are unable to contact you via the contact methods provided 
prior to the time that we make up your order, we will assume that you 
accept the substitution.</p>
				<br><h4>Damaged flowers</h4>
				<p>Although we do our best to ensure that this does not happen, on 
very rare occasions, flowers arrive at their destination damaged. If the
 recipient receives damaged flowers, please contact us immediately so 
that we can arrange one of the following:</p>
				 <ul class="list">
				 <li>a re-send on the next available delivery date, or</li>
				 <li>a full refund</li>
				</ul>
				<br><h4>100% satisfaction guarantee</h4>
				<a name="guarantee"></a><p>Our 100% satisfaction guarantee only 
applies to the products (excluding sundries such as the card message) 
and aspects of our service that we (or our fulfillment partners) have 
direct control over. The guarantee is not applicable to issues that are 
outside our control such as incorrect or incomplete addresses provided 
by the customer or refused deliveries (for example, a refused delivery 
to a hospital). In addition, for Postal Flower orders, customers are 
unable to claim under the 100% satisfaction guarantee if the delivery is
 not made on the chosen delivery date (as detailed on our delivery 
information page).</p>
				<p>A summary of our resolution policy is shown below:</p>
				<ul class="list">
				<li>In the event of non-delivery on the selected delivery date, we will either refund you in full or redelivery your order. <em>This does not apply for postal flower orders</em>.</li>
				<li>In the event of late-delivery on the selected delivery date, we 
will either refund you the delivery charge paid for your order and offer
 compensation via discount vouchers.  <em>This does not apply for postal flower orders</em>.</li>
				<li>In the event of damaged products being received, we will either 
refund you in full or redeliver a replacement for the damaged 
product(s). Please note that it may be necessary to return the original 
product in order to receive the refund.</li>
				<li>If we are unable to fulfill your order, we will refund you in full.</li>
				<li>If we send the wrong product, we will resend the correct 
product. Please note that it may be necessary to return the original 
product received.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please note that all compensation will be in the form of a full 
or partial-refund against the original payment or in the form of 
discount vouchers for use in a future order. We are unable to provide 
any other form of financial compensation under any circumstances.</p>
				<br><h4>Special offers</h4>
				<p>At our discretion, from time to time, we may offer products at 
discounted prices. These offers are valid from the time that we 
introduce them to the end date of the offer and they cannot be used for 
purchases before the offer introduction date or after the offer end 
date.</p>
				<p>In the event that a customer has made a purchase and the price of
 the purchased product subsequently falls or is discounted owing to a 
special offer, the price of the product at the time of purchase shall 
'prevail'. We are unable to offer special offer discounts for purchases 
that have already been made.</p>
				<p>As our special offers are contingent on the availability of 
products, we may change the terms of special offers, or withdraw them 
altogether, at any time, and without prior notice.</p>
				<p>We also reserve the right to offer different personalised special
 offers and promotions and it will therefore only be possible for the 
customer in receipt of the special offer to redeem the discount.</p>
				<br><h4>Customer and recipient personal information</h4>
				<p>To ensure that we can communicate effectively with both customers
 and recipients, it is very important that you provide accurate personal
 information.</p>
				<p>Please remember that we value your privacy and will never lease, 
rent or sell your private information. Period. For more information, 
please see our <a href="http://m.serenataflowers.com/iphone/policy">privacy policy</a>.</p>
				<p>At the checkout, we ask for the following personal information:</p>
				<ul class="list"> 
				 <li><strong>Customer's email address</strong> <br>We use this 
information to provide a better customer experience by sending order 
confirmations, dispatch confirmations and delivery confirmations. We 
will also use the customer's email address in the event that we need to 
make substitutions. Please ensure that email addresses are accurate. 
				 </li><li><strong>Customer's full name and address</strong> <br>We 
use this information for credit card validation and for direct mailing 
(only if you have agreed to receipt of these mailings).
				 </li><li><strong>Customer's telephone number</strong> (and mobile number) <br>We
 use this information to contact customers in the event of problems with
 the order such as payment failures or delivery issues.
				 </li><li><strong>Recipient's full name and address</strong> <br>We 
require this information in order to deliver the flowers you have 
ordered. It is vital that the recipient's address is accurate.
				 </li></ul>
				<p>Thank you for you order, and we hope your Serenata experience will be a pleasurable one.</p>
				<br><h4>Calls to our customer services team from mobile phones and abroad</h4>
				<p>We provide freephone telephone numbers for our customer services 
team. These numbers are free to call from a UK landline. Calling these 
numbers from a mobile phone or from abroad may incur charges. Whilst 
convenient, mobile phones can be expensive to use and you should note 
some service providers charge for calls to free phone numbers (this is 
outside our control). We regret that we cannot reimburse any telephone 
costs incurred when using mobile phones or when calling from abroad. It 
is therefore recommended that a landline phone be used wherever possible
 when calling our customer services team. Alternatively, contact us via 
email, live chat or our 'call me back' service.</p>
